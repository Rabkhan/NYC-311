# NYC 311 Service Requests Analytics

## Problem Statement
New York City receives over 3 million service requests annually through its 311 system, from noise complaints and potholes to heating issues and illegal parking. This massive volume of citizen feedback contains valuable insights about city operations, service quality, and community needs, but remains largely untapped due to:

- **Data Fragmentation**: 24+ million records spread across multiple systems with inconsistent formats
- **Limited Visibility**: No centralized view of service patterns, response times, or agency performance  
- **Reactive Management**: City agencies lack predictive insights to proactively address recurring issues
- **Public Transparency Gap**: Citizens have limited visibility into how their requests are handled and resolved
